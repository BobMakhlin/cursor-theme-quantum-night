# Quantum Night – Cursor Theme (Angular & Vue.js)

Quantum Night is a dark Cursor theme inspired by JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA, with a few opinionated UI tweaks for front-end development. It ships as two ready-to-use settings presets:

- `angular-dev-settings.json` – tuned for Angular projects
- `vuejs-dev-settings.json` – tuned for Vue.js projects

## What you get

- Dark IntelliJ-like color scheme for Cursor
- Consistent editor look & feel for Angular / Vue projects
- Opinionated editor settings to reduce visual noise and keep focus on code

## How to use

1. **Pick a preset**

   Download either:

   - `angular-dev-settings.json` for Angular  
   - `vuejs-dev-settings.json` for Vue.js

2. **Open Cursor settings (JSON)**

   In Cursor:

   - Press <kbd>Ctrl/Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>,</kbd>
   - Search for **“Open Settings (JSON)”** and open it

3. **Apply the preset**

   - Replace your existing JSON with the contents of the chosen file **or**
   - Merge the parts you like into your current `settings.json`

4. **(Optional) Per-project settings**

   You can also drop the file into your project as `.vscode/settings.json` (or `.cursor/settings.json` if you prefer) to apply the theme only for that workspace.
